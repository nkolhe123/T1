"Can RCB win IPL 2018?"
"Virat Kohli has been a regular captain for RCB since 2013.. Now that is 5 seasons, and RCB have reached the final just once under him, and losing there too.. So maybe it is not the team that's not performing, perhaps it's the captain who has just been unable to deliver..This is one of comment in crickbuzz during RCB vs MI match- “Kohli will never become as good a captain as Rohit in T20. He should know that leg spinners and left arm pacers have always troubled Rohit, still did not bring either of Chahal or Anderson during powerplay allowing Rohit to settle.”So as far as I think, whether it wins or not entirely depends on Kohli’s captaincy and he has to improve in it."

"It's hardly impossible now,they have just won 3 out of there 10 games and are currently sitting at 9th Position.But they are still in the tournament.Delhi is the only team that is out of the Race of IPL. RCB is still in race but it is very hard for them as to reach qualifiers they have to win there all the remaining 4matches. They have to face SRH,KXIP,DD AND RR in upcoming matches . We all know in which form Srh and KXIP and are also playing in good momentum and DD will try it's best to knock others team out of the team as they have nothing to lose and they will play fearlessly,all the pressure will be on BANGALORE.But RCB still has not lost his hopes and they will try to put there best. They should win there left matches with big differences that will boost up there NET RUN RATE and if they won there all matches still at the end there luck may depend on other teams.Let’s hope for the best. ABD and KOHLI should take the responsibility and play wisely."

"Why not?They have top class players from across the world.Then why aren't they able to win ??Is this his fault?I don't think so!Most of the people blame his captaincy to be the reason why RCB hasn't won an IPL title.Well guys, it's not his fault.Rcb have no doubt got some of the best batsmen in the world and some exceptional players,but have they got ballers?There balling has always been there weakness,but this year they do have some dependable bowlers!Tim southeeUmesh yadavChris woakesCorey AndersonMoeen AliAnd so on!I think this year RCB has the most balanced team ever!Yes,they might have won only 1 match out of 4 ,but I believe they'll soon cover it up.And now,coming back to your question.Can RCB win IPL 2018?Yes,they can and If you ask me they have a very good chance of doing so!RCBian forever :)P.S-(Image courtesy-Google)"
"Will rcb win the IPL 2018?"
"No!!!!RCB has always been a team containing star studded batsmen in their lineup. But it's been the bowling that has always let down the team.This year also they have done the same mistake by not picking an impact bowler. The likes of woakes, yadav don't change the equation since they were expensive while playing for KKR. Also taking into fact that Bangalore being a small ground ,does not help the bowlers cause.When Coulter Nile was injured I thought they would replace with a good bowler like dala, henriques or morkel. But again they did a mistake by picking Corey Anderson who is not in good form off late.Yes,they have a good spinners in their squad but the problem is with the ground dimensions and also Bangalore pitch offers only a little assistance to spinners.The bowling department of RCB has let them down in the previous years and I think this year is also going to be the same.The other reason why I'm saying RCB won't win is that the quality of the players in the squad. Apart from kohli, bazz and devilliers the squad looks weak and inexperienced when compared to other teams squad.Cheers!!! Thank you."
"Yes, why not.Infact, Royal challenger Bangalore is the most probable team IPL 2018.As far as the record is concerned, with 3 wins and 2 wins, CSK AND MI have more chances even this year. Every team has their own strength and weakness, but there is nothing certain in short format matches. Let’s have a quick look at all team squad.Now, let’s have a quick view of the winning capability of every team.Delhi Daredevils – Gautam Gambhir, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh pant will Lead the batting side. Mohammed Shami, Trent Boult, and Chris Morris will lead the Bowling side.Kings XI Punjab – Yuvraj Singh, Chris Gayle will lead the batting side. Ashwin and Andrew Tye will lead the bowling side.Kolkata Knightriders – Dinesh Karthik, Robin Uthappa will lead the batting side. Sunil Naraine and Andre Russell will lead the bowling side.Royal Challengers Bangalore – Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Brendon McCullum will lead the batting side. Yuzvendra Chahal and Nathan Coulter-Nile will lead the Bowling side.Chennai Super Kings – MS Dhoni, Suresh Raina will lead the batting side. Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh will lead the Bowling side.Mumbai Indians – Rohit Sharma and Kieron Pollard will lead the batting side. Jasprit Bumrah and Mustafizur Rahman will lead the bowling side.Sunrisers Hyderabad – David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan will lead the batting side. Bhuwneshwar Kumar and Rashid Khan will lead the Bowling side.Rajasthan Royals – Smith and Rahane will lead the Batting side. Dhawal Kulkarni, Stuart Binny will lead the Bowling side.Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challenger Bangalore will be the most probable team for the IPL final.Source - IPL 2018"
"ust look at that batting line-up: Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Brendon McCullum, Quinton de Kock, Parthiv Patel, Sarfaraz Khan, Manan Vohra and Mandeep Singh.If that’s not enough, here are the all-rounders: Moeen Ali, Washington Sundar, Pawan Negi, Chris Woakes, and Colin de Grandhomme.If even that weren’t enough, check out the bowlers: Umesh Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, M Siraj, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Tim Southee, Navdeep Saini and M Ashwin.If RCB don’t break their IPL title duck this year, they should just stop playing. so i think that big possible RCB win IPL 2018."
"Tough task for them and the reason being their bowling. Always Bangalore has been suffering from poor bowlers. Yes they have good bowling attack this time with Yadav, Chahal and Woakes. But they don’t have domestic bowler who is good enough to support the other bowlers and same is with batting. Siraj is not a matured bowler and Mandeep is starting to show his betterment. Sarfaraz hasn’t been in great form since last IPL.If RCB has to win the title then all the players should perform and not just VK."
"Will RCB win in the IPL 2018?"
"Nope.It is because their bowling is very weak,although they managed to all out kxip at 88 but it was because of Punjabs poor batting.Then they also have issues with their batting.Barring Kohli and AB nobody is consistent even they are not.Thats why there chances of winning are very less."
