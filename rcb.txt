"Six wins from 14 matches. Worse death bowling stats. Muddled middle-order. Strange pre-auction retention. You get the drift, don’t you? If there’s one team that can pull all of it off in a single season, it has to be Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), whose campaign, once again ended without them qualifying for the playoffs."
"Virat Kohli topped the batting charts for RCB. AFP"
"While a third-from-bottom finish suggests a performance that has only marginally improved from their last-place result of 2017, it also spawns a suspicion of fundamental ineptness that has consistently seen them punching below their weight for most of their existence."
"For far too many seasons, RCB have reneged on their promise and 2018 - with all the freshness that change in personnel ushers in – toed the familiar script of underperformance."
"What went wrong?"
"Pretty much everything and the bungling had started much before crisp collars and sharp suits assembled in Bengaluru’s Ritz-Carlton for the mega auction on the last weekend of January. Sarfaraz Khan, a doubtlessly prodigious age-group cricketer but with little to show for in Twenty20 cricket, was retained pre-auction, and KL Rahul, good enough to score international hundreds in all three formats, was duly dispensed with."
"The elegant right-hander was RCB’s third-highest run-getter in 2016 and had missed the 2017 edition due to a shoulder injury after acing the tough home series against Australia earlier that year. Letting him go was a surprise, and the fact that RCB didn’t once bid for him in auction confirmed that they were certain to look beyond him, which was a surprise, considering his well-documented talent to score quickly and correctly."
"Rahul triggered a fierce bidding war between Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Kings XI Punjab, and was ultimately taken by Punjab at 5.5 times his base price of Rs. 2 crore. He justified his price with 659 runs from 14 matches, ending IPL 2018 as third-highest scorer."
"That apart, RCB had a formidable squad – on paper, at least – and with Chris Woakes, Umesh Yadav, Tim Southee and Nathan Coulter-Nile in their ranks, one was impressed with their fast-bowling arsenal. Though Coulter-Nile was ruled out because of injury before the start of IPL, they still looked good in the pace department. In Yuzvendra Chahal, Murugan Ashwin, and Washington Sundar, they had a potent spin attack too, while Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers and Mandeep Singh looked set to shore up batting."
"However, bowling once again proved to be their undoing. Their bowlers, with the exception of Umesh Yadav – whose 20 wickets made him this season’s second-highest wicket-taker – were found wanting under the relentless assault of increasingly daring batsmen, and the unit completely crumbled in death overs. Nothing illustrates RCB’s death-bowling woes better than their failed defence of 205 runs against Chennai Super Kings (CSK). After being in command for 14 overs of CSK innings, RCB conceded 80 in last six overs as MS Dhoni and Ambati Rayudu’s stunning six-hitting assault sank their defence and morale."
"Apart from death-bowling, RCB’s middle-order failed to fire in IPL 2018. With the exception of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers, and some timely cameos from Mandeep Singh, no batsman made a lasting impact. In their last must-win game against Rajasthan Royals, RCB lost seven wickets for 33 runs and lost by 30 runs — this after being 75/1 at one stage."
"Turning point of the season"
"For a team that could never really get on a roll, the turning point has to be their most morale-shattering loss, and that, in this writer’s opinion, was the match against CSK. It was a game where RCB’s batting artillery boomed in all its murderous glory — Quinton de Kock hit 37-ball 53, AB de Villiers hit eight sixes en route his 30-ball 68, and Mandeep Singh’s 32 came off 17 balls. RCB racked up 205/8 and reduced CSK to 74/4 at the end of the ninth over."
"However, a combination of calculated CSK assault — orchestrated by the seasoned Dhoni and an in-form Rayudu, sloppy fielding and ordinary bowling ensured the visitors were let off the hook. A 101-run partnership killed the game for CSK, and the 15 sixes that Rayudu-Dhoni hit broke the back of RCB attack."
"By the time Rayudu fell to a Umesh Yadav throw — who had earlier dropped him — the chase was all but sealed. It was CSK’s biggest run chase in 11 years of IPL, and while it took a sterling effort from Dhoni and Rayudu to make it happen, the contribution of RCB’s toothless attack can’t be ignored."
"Kohli admitted RCB’s bowling was “just not acceptable”; pity that his bowlers did precious little course correction thereafter."
"Hits and Flops"
"Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers form the core of RCB, and the trio did its best to keep team’s playoff chances alive till the last day of the league phase."
"Skipper Kohli continued to be team’s batting mainstay with 530 runs, while De Villiers ended as RCB’s second-highest scorer with 480 runs. The duo occupies the sixth and eighth spots respectively on the overall standings at the end of the league phase. The gulf between them and the rest of the RCB batsmen is exemplified by the fact that the third-highest scorer for RCB, Mandeep Singh, sits on the 29th spot of this season’s top run-getters’ list."
"Apart from these three, the batting was a disappointment and on more than one occasions, the middle-order imploded. The likes of Colin de Grandhomme and Moeen Ali shone in patches, but a definitive, match-turning performance never arrived. Corey Anderson was another overseas player who failed to deliver. Brought in as a replacement for injured Nathan Coulter-Nile, the Kiwi all-rounder was a comprehensive failure with both bat and ball. He took three wickets from as many matches at an economy of over 13 runs per over, and his death-bowling left a lot to be desired. His three innings yielded 17 runs at a strike-rate of 77.27."
"Among the Indian buys, the biggest let-down was Washington Sundar. This was the Tamil Nadu all-rounder’s big chance to make an impression after a successful gig at Tamil Nadu Premier League and a reasonably good India stint. He scored only 65 runs from 7 matches and picked just four wickets at an economy of 9.60. Sundar’s forgettable season sent RCB’s team combination in a tailspin, and the lack of a reliable middle-order batsman showed up more than once."
"What next for them?"
"It would be too early to advocate wholesale changes in their squad, but letting go of Rahul was a mistake that could have been avoided. RCB need to find a decent middle-order batsman who can fire consistently. Mandeep Singh has shown promise and must be persisted with."
"Quinton de Kock scored 201 runs from eight matches, and was only their fourth batsman to cross the 200-run mark. He was neat behind the stumps and showed sporadic brilliance with the bat. However, his value to the team must also be judged in terms of the balance he renders to the team. In him and Parthiv Patel, RCB have two aggressive wicketkeeper-batsmen who can capitalise on the Powerplay overs."
"The biggest change RCB must bring in is to give more thought to their team selections. Sarfaraz Khan and Pawan Negi did little to justify Kohli’s faith, and continued non-selection of talented Navdeep Saini belies conventional wisdom. More than anything else though, RCB would do well to believe they can defend totals. Throughout the IPL 2018, Kohli never sounded confident of his bowlers, who did little to change their skipper’s scepticism. They discovered Umesh Yadav’s utility with new ball; it’s time they find someone who can do the trick with the older one."

"It’s the time of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Every year, as the IPL commences, people in Bangalore wonder whether Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) will win this time around."
"RCB fans come with a lot of enthusiasm and big hopes – theirs should, by all means, be a dominant team considering it has lots of big names. But when these big names fail to deliver, the enthusiasm of the fans turns into tears."
"As an RCB fan, the repeated failure of RCB is quite painful to watch. Gradually, as seasons passed, people labelled them ‘chokers’ because it was a team with lots of big-name players but they weren’t able to perform. Many RCB fans have tried to find the reason behind the team’s losses."
"I have my own ideas as to why the team struggles so much and hasn’t been able to win the trophy even once. Let’s take a look at them."
"This is one of the main reasons behind the team’s failures. The team has always had big names like Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, Dale Steyn, Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers and more along with some of the worst performers. When these big names have a bad day, the entire team collapses. The team needs players who may not be exceptional but are solid and dependable. We rarely find great teamwork from the team. This lack of teamwork has been a major reason behind the team’s losses."
"As we all know, in T20s, teams with bowlers who can make an impact have more of a chance to prevail over their opponents. And RCB has lacked a reliable bowling attack. But I feel the team’s bowling has been gradually improving over the seasons. When a world class bowler like Daniel Vettori is their bowling coach, they should have a much stronger bowling side. The team management should focus more on bowling."
"In the IPL, every team generally has 4-5 domestic players. Ultimately, a team’s performance depends on the performance of domestic talent. But in the case of RCB, I have observed that most of the domestic players performed quite poorly. No one had expected Rajasthan Royals to win the 2008 IPL because they didn’t have more than 2-3 world class players in their line up but they were able to do so due to an outstanding performance from their domestic players. RCB should try and be more careful when selecting domestic players during auctions."
"Many critics try and blame the captain for the team’s losses but I don’t think that’s quite right in this case. If RCB improves in the above-mentioned sections, then the day won’t be far when they will be able to bring home the IPL trophy."
"
	
	Desperation to secure a maiden win was clearly visible in Mumbai Indians' body language on Tuesday. Royal Challengers Banglore (RCB), led by Virat Kohli, on the other hand, needed this win to gain back the momentum they lost against Rajasthan Royals at Bengalure's Chinnaswamy Stadium in the previous match. Kohli won the toss and asked Rohit Sharma's Mumbai Indians to bat first. It turned out, toss was the only thing RCB were going to win. "
"
	Umesh Yadav gave RCB a dream start by bowling out opener Suryakumar Yadav, who failed to move his feet, on the very first ball of the match. Ishan Kishan was the next to follow; he got out in a similar fashion on the next ball. Two balls, two wickets, zero runs. But then, that was it! document.write(""<!--"");if(isUserBanner==""free""&&(displayConBanner==1))document.write(""-->"");googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/6516239/outofpage_1x1_desktop','div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0').addService(googletag.pubads());googletag.pubads().enableSyncRendering();googletag.enableServices();});"
"
	Evin Lewis and Rohit Sharma got together and made sure the morale of the RCB bowlers hit rock bottom and Mumbai Indians' score crossed the 200 mark. There is some curious problem with RCB bowlers. They never capitalise on a favourable situation that comes up during the course of a match. For example, RCB should have put pressure on MI batsmen after they lost two wickets off two balls. But they did not."
"
	Chris Woakes, Corey Anderson, and Umesh Yadav were not able to trouble Rohit Sharma and Evin Lewis at all. The reason: they were not bowling in the corridor of uncertainty and they did not try yorkers or slower ones. They were bowling either too full for too short, making it all the more easy for the batsmen to hit out of the park with ease to score big. "

"
	Meanwhile, spinners didn't bowl well, either. They disappointed Captain Virat Kohli and made him question his decision to bowl first on a flat deck. Washington Sundar gave away 32 runs in just two over. Yuzvendra Chahal was expensive, too. Here, the team selection and on-field captaincy must be questioned, yet again. There are bowlers like Tim Southee warming the bench for RCB.  Why can't he replace Chris Woakes, who has leaked runs in all the four matches so far? Kohli has failed to use his bowlers to the best of their abilities and there seems to be no innovation.
	During the 14th match of IPL 2018, Kohli was seen taking instructions from the RCB bowling coach, Ashish Nehra. It was clear that the bowlers had no idea about how they could counter the onslaught by the MI batsmen. Their inability to bowl the wide yorkers and dot balls showed that there was lack of strategic practice before the game. This is a huge mistake on the part of the team management and coaches."
"
	By the end of MI's 20 overs, RCB had leaked 213 runs and given themselves a mountain to climb. Rohit Sharma missed a well-deserved century by six runs."
"
	Coming to bat, Virat Kohli opened with Quinton De Kock. Brendon McCullum was dropped from the team because of his inability to perform consistently. They both had a decent start. De Kock again failed to overcome his issue of trying and hitting too much. He stepped out of his crease to smash a fast bowler and paid the price."
"
	AB De Villiers was the next man in. What he did was beyond forgiveness. If a player like ABD throws his wicket away in the same over where a wicket has already fallen, it is simply not acceptable . He did the same in the previous match, and this one was no different. Chasing a target that is more than 200, a team needs ABD to fire. ABD just couldn't realise how difficult it would be for RCB to score if he departed. One shouldn't start hitting extravagant shots the moment they come in. ABD has thoroughly failed so far in this year's IPL. His failure has put immense pressure on Virat Kohli and the team."
"
	Mandeep Singh was a disappointment in the match. He has played decent knocks in the tournament and there were hopes from him as well. He was trapped in the net by Krunal Pandya. His stumping was missed by Ishan Kishan, as the ball was too wide off the stump -- neither Mandeep nor Ishan could reach. However, Krunal bowled the same delivery again and this time Ishan did not miss. He was dismissed cheaply. What applies to ABD applies to Corey Anderson as well. This was his first match in this year's IPL. He came after Mandeep was out and he hit the very first ball in the air and was dismissed. How irresponsible! He came in just to increase the pressure on his team, it seemed."
"
	Shahbaz Khan could have helped the cause, had he shown some temperament. He was dropped in the previous match and it was his opportunity to score. Well, his technique and talent failed him, and he failed the team. All Virat Kohli could do was try and reduce the margin of defeat. He made 92 and RCB lost by 46 runs, giving Mumbai their first win."
"
	After a host of poor performances in the previous editions of IPL, RCB will have to do a lot to ensure they do not end up at the bottom of the heap in IPL 2018 as well."
"After the IPL auction this year, Royal Challengers Bangalore had been deemed as one of the best teams on paper. They had top-class batsmen in Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers and Quinton de Kock, young spin sensations Yuzvendra Chahal and Washington Sundar, and the likes of Umesh Yadav and Chris Woakes in their pace attack. They seemed to have ticked all the boxes."
"After a terrible outing last season, many believed this was a squad that could turn things around for the franchise."
"Halfway through the group stage though, Indian skipper Virat Kohli's RCB have slumped to five losses in seven matches. Right now, their chances of making play-offs look as slight as the percentage of successful catches they’ve made this season."
"So what went wrong?"
"Here’s a look at some factors that could have been the main reasons behind Bangalore’s failure to win matches despite having a winning combination."
"With stars like Virat and AB de Villiers, RCB have always been known for their enviable batting line-up. This season, the management appeared to have made a conscious decision to invest in their bowling line-up. Besides bringing Chahal and Pawan Negi back, the franchise bagged two other spinners — Sundar and Murugan Ashwin. The team has five Indian pace options along with Kiwi star Tim Southee. That’s not all. RCB also has Moeen Ali, Colin de Grandhomme and Chris Woakes for all-rounders."
"All these options, but RCB has suffered most in their death overs. Looking back at the games they’ve played so far, and one notices that since first-choice bowlers Umesh Yadav and Chahal bowl all their four overs early on, the pressure of the death overs is usually felt by the foreign players or Sundar, which has proved to be expensive."
"While Virat and de Villiers are among the top run-getters in the ongoing season of the IPL, several names who were expected to perform haven’t quite managed to make a mark so far. The opening combination of the Quinton de Kock and Brendon McCullum had partnerships of 18, 1 and 4 in the first three games after which McCullum was dropped and Kohli elevated to the opening spot. But for RCB, putting up totals hasn’t been as much of an issue as defending totals has been."
"India’s star wristspinner Yuzi Chahal has picked up seven wickets in seven matches while star campaigner in the Nidahas Trophy, Sundar, has managed just four wickets in 6 matches. In fact, death overs specialist Woakes has been hit for a lot of runs in the final overs, returning with figures of 0/40, 1/31, 2/47, 2/36 and 3/36."
"Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers came as obvious choices for Royal Challengers Bangalore to retain for the 11th edition of the IPL. But their third choice, Sarfraz Khan, came as a mystery. Some wondered whether picking him was a way to give the captain more money, or if RCB was just trying to save money."
"Either way, the third player could have been retained for up to Rs 3 crore, which meant RCB could have gone for a wiser choice. And that may have just made the difference."
"Dropping Ambati Rayudu in the match against Chennai Super Kings or Chris Lynn in the one against Kolkata Knight Riders, fielding has definitely not been one of RCB’s strong points this season. Captain Kohli himself admitted after the loss to KKR on 29 April, the lapse in fielding."
"On the bright side, RCB can still qualify for the play-offs. The franchise needs at least six wins in the seven games that they have remaining. What’s left to see, if captain Virat can bolster a turnaround like that!"

"Can RCB win IPL 2018?"
"Virat Kohli has been a regular captain for RCB since 2013.. Now that is 5 seasons, and RCB have reached the final just once under him, and losing there too.. So maybe it is not the team that's not performing, perhaps it's the captain who has just been unable to deliver..This is one of comment in crickbuzz during RCB vs MI match- “Kohli will never become as good a captain as Rohit in T20. He should know that leg spinners and left arm pacers have always troubled Rohit, still did not bring either of Chahal or Anderson during powerplay allowing Rohit to settle.”So as far as I think, whether it wins or not entirely depends on Kohli’s captaincy and he has to improve in it."

"It's hardly impossible now,they have just won 3 out of there 10 games and are currently sitting at 9th Position.But they are still in the tournament.Delhi is the only team that is out of the Race of IPL. RCB is still in race but it is very hard for them as to reach qualifiers they have to win there all the remaining 4matches. They have to face SRH,KXIP,DD AND RR in upcoming matches . We all know in which form Srh and KXIP and are also playing in good momentum and DD will try it's best to knock others team out of the team as they have nothing to lose and they will play fearlessly,all the pressure will be on BANGALORE.But RCB still has not lost his hopes and they will try to put there best. They should win there left matches with big differences that will boost up there NET RUN RATE and if they won there all matches still at the end there luck may depend on other teams.Let’s hope for the best. ABD and KOHLI should take the responsibility and play wisely."
"Can RCB win the IPL 2018?"
"Why not?They have top class players from across the world.Then why aren't they able to win ??Is this his fault?I don't think so!Most of the people blame his captaincy to be the reason why RCB hasn't won an IPL title.Well guys, it's not his fault.Rcb have no doubt got some of the best batsmen in the world and some exceptional players,but have they got ballers?There balling has always been there weakness,but this year they do have some dependable bowlers!Tim southeeUmesh yadavChris woakesCorey AndersonMoeen AliAnd so on!I think this year RCB has the most balanced team ever!Yes,they might have won only 1 match out of 4 ,but I believe they'll soon cover it up.And now,coming back to your question.Can RCB win IPL 2018?Yes,they can and If you ask me they have a very good chance of doing so!RCBian forever :)P.S-(Image courtesy-Google)"
"Will rcb win the IPL 2018?"
"No!!!!RCB has always been a team containing star studded batsmen in their lineup. But it's been the bowling that has always let down the team.This year also they have done the same mistake by not picking an impact bowler. The likes of woakes, yadav don't change the equation since they were expensive while playing for KKR. Also taking into fact that Bangalore being a small ground ,does not help the bowlers cause.When Coulter Nile was injured I thought they would replace with a good bowler like dala, henriques or morkel. But again they did a mistake by picking Corey Anderson who is not in good form off late.Yes,they have a good spinners in their squad but the problem is with the ground dimensions and also Bangalore pitch offers only a little assistance to spinners.The bowling department of RCB has let them down in the previous years and I think this year is also going to be the same.The other reason why I'm saying RCB won't win is that the quality of the players in the squad. Apart from kohli, bazz and devilliers the squad looks weak and inexperienced when compared to other teams squad.Cheers!!! Thank you."
"Yes, why not.Infact, Royal challenger Bangalore is the most probable team IPL 2018.As far as the record is concerned, with 3 wins and 2 wins, CSK AND MI have more chances even this year. Every team has their own strength and weakness, but there is nothing certain in short format matches. Let’s have a quick look at all team squad.Now, let’s have a quick view of the winning capability of every team.Delhi Daredevils – Gautam Gambhir, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh pant will Lead the batting side. Mohammed Shami, Trent Boult, and Chris Morris will lead the Bowling side.Kings XI Punjab – Yuvraj Singh, Chris Gayle will lead the batting side. Ashwin and Andrew Tye will lead the bowling side.Kolkata Knightriders – Dinesh Karthik, Robin Uthappa will lead the batting side. Sunil Naraine and Andre Russell will lead the bowling side.Royal Challengers Bangalore – Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Brendon McCullum will lead the batting side. Yuzvendra Chahal and Nathan Coulter-Nile will lead the Bowling side.Chennai Super Kings – MS Dhoni, Suresh Raina will lead the batting side. Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh will lead the Bowling side.Mumbai Indians – Rohit Sharma and Kieron Pollard will lead the batting side. Jasprit Bumrah and Mustafizur Rahman will lead the bowling side.Sunrisers Hyderabad – David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan will lead the batting side. Bhuwneshwar Kumar and Rashid Khan will lead the Bowling side.Rajasthan Royals – Smith and Rahane will lead the Batting side. Dhawal Kulkarni, Stuart Binny will lead the Bowling side.Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challenger Bangalore will be the most probable team for the IPL final.Source - IPL 2018"
"ust look at that batting line-up: Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Brendon McCullum, Quinton de Kock, Parthiv Patel, Sarfaraz Khan, Manan Vohra and Mandeep Singh.If that’s not enough, here are the all-rounders: Moeen Ali, Washington Sundar, Pawan Negi, Chris Woakes, and Colin de Grandhomme.If even that weren’t enough, check out the bowlers: Umesh Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, M Siraj, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Tim Southee, Navdeep Saini and M Ashwin.If RCB don’t break their IPL title duck this year, they should just stop playing. so i think that big possible RCB win IPL 2018."
"Tough task for them and the reason being their bowling. Always Bangalore has been suffering from poor bowlers. Yes they have good bowling attack this time with Yadav, Chahal and Woakes. But they don’t have domestic bowler who is good enough to support the other bowlers and same is with batting. Siraj is not a matured bowler and Mandeep is starting to show his betterment. Sarfaraz hasn’t been in great form since last IPL.If RCB has to win the title then all the players should perform and not just VK."
"Will RCB win in the IPL 2018?"
"Nope.It is because their bowling is very weak,although they managed to all out kxip at 88 but it was because of Punjabs poor batting.Then they also have issues with their batting.Barring Kohli and AB nobody is consistent even they are not.Thats why there chances of winning are very less."
